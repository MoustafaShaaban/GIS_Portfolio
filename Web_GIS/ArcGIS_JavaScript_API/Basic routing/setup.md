# To get an API key you will need an ArcGIS Developer developer account, you can follow this tutorial:

[Create and manage an API key](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/mapping-apis-and-services/security/tutorials/create-and-manage-an-api-key/)


# Once you have an API key open the [JavaScript file](javascript/script.js) and add your API key inside the double quotes on line 19 inside the esriConfig.apiKey:

esriConfig.apiKey = "";

# Now you can run the project by opening the [index.html file](index.html) in your web browser.
