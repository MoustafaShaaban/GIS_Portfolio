* This repository contians my GIS projects.
* Currently it has some of projects under the name of USA_Maps_and_Analysis.

#### The first project is an interactive web map showing the Public Schools in Seattle:

* There are two versions of this project:
  * 1- Using the Python programming language.   (Folium)
  * 2- Using the JavaScript programming language.   (ArcGIS JavaScript API)

[Seattle Public Schools with Folium](https://github.com/MoustafaShaaban/GIS_Portfolio/tree/main/USA_Maps_and_Analysis/Seattle/Web_Maps/Public_Schools)

[Seattle Public Schools with ArcGIS JavaScript API](https://github.com/MoustafaShaaban/GIS_Portfolio/tree/main/USA_Maps_and_Analysis/Seattle/Web_Maps/ArcGIS_JS_API)

* In this project I used a Python package called [Folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/) and the [ArcGIS JavaScript API](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/)



#### The second project contains interactive and static maps of the USA:

* The interactive map shows a choropleth map of the population count in the USA by each state, and also shows some population studies like the population growth from 2010 to 2021.
* This project was created by another python library called [Geopandas](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/index.html)

* The static maps also shows some populations study like population count and population density, These maps were created by a free open source GIS software called
[QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/)

#### The fourth project contains an interactive web map built with ArcGIS JavaScript API:

* This project contains two mini sub project:

    [Basic Routing](https://github.com/MoustafaShaaban/GIS_Portfolio/tree/main/Web_GIS/ArcGIS_JavaScript_API/Basic%20routing)

    * In this project we can find the shortest path between two or more locations.

    [Searching for Nearby Places](https://github.com/MoustafaShaaban/GIS_Portfolio/tree/main/Web_GIS/ArcGIS_JavaScript_API/Searching_for_places)

    * In this project we can search for nearby places like hospitals, hotels, parks ...
