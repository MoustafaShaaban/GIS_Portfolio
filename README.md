* This repository contians my GIS projects.
* Currently it has some of projects under the name of USA_Maps_and_Analysis.

#### The first project is an interactive web map showing the Public Schools in Seattle:

[Seattle Public Schools](https://github.com/MoustafaShaaban/GIS_Portfolio/tree/main/USA_Maps_and_Analysis/Seattle/Web_Maps/Public_Schools)

* In this project I used a Python package called [Folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/)

* According to Folium docs:

> folium builds on the data wrangling strengths of the Python ecosystem and the mapping strengths of the leaflet.js library. Manipulate your data in Python, then visualize it in on a Leaflet map via folium.

#### The second project contains interactive and static maps of the USA:

* The interactive map shows a choropleth map of the population count in the USA by each state, and also shows some population studies like the population growth from 2010 to 2021.
* This project was created by another python library called [Geopandas](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/index.html)
